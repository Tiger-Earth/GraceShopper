Establishing Norms

Each group should discuss and provide an answer for the following questions

What does this group do when two or more members disagree (ex. on a technical approach, a technology choice, etc)?
_Do you vote? Does the whole group get involved? Do you get someone else to decide?_

* Get group consensus
* If there are concerns, ask a fellow

What does this group do when a member is frustrated?
_What strategy do you use to talk about it? What do you do if you're the frustrated person? What do you do if you're the person someone is frustrated with? Imagine a situation where Person A thinks that Person B is not pulling their weight_ - _write a script for how you think that conversation should go._

* Don’t internalize your frustrations!
* Keep communication open, don’t make it personal

_Do members of a pair decide their own norms? Do they do things like keep a timer to switch positions? How often do we switch partners?_

How does this group approach work "after hours" (i.e. after normal class hours and weekends)?
